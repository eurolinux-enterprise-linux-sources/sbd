2013-07-04 - v1.2.0

This is, finally, a public release after several years of development
and living mostly in SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability 11 (and
previously, cluster-glue).

"sbd" ("shared-storage based death", named originally in deference to
Novell Cluster Suite's "split brain detector") is a highly reliable
fencing mechanism that utilizes shared storage for arbitration and
exchange of fencing commands.

New in this release:
- Initial public release
- Move to github
